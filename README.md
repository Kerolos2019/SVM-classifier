# SVM-classifier

to make a classification task in computer vision you may use convolutional neural network and make the model detect the features it want to make the classification but it needs high computational power with large dataset to train on it   or you can use machine learning like support vector machine , support vector machine will not take computational power or large datasets but you need to extract features by your self , here i have used HOG " histogram oriented gradient" to detect the features of cars and trucks and feed the features to the SVM model  , i have just used about 8000 images for each class  , i have also used search grid to improve the performance of the network.
